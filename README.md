# Perang Gagal
 A repository of SuperCollider code, audio samples, and musical notation related to ‘Perang Gagal: a Series of Inconclusive Battles’ as performed at the International Conference on Livecoding (ICLC) Limerick 2020.

 (But, this repo is a work in progress, none of this ready to use yet…!)
